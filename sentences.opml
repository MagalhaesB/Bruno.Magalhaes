has collected the material under Fenna’s supervision and Annelieke has written up this first draft." /><outline text="We explore household cleaning practices in which the ambition is not to care for ‘ecological clean’ alongside ‘hygienic clean’ and ‘aesthetically clean’ with the hope to distil some lessons about how to better support these practices so that they may be adopted more widely." /><outline text="We aim to submit to The Sociological Review, a journal that allows us a generous 8000 words excluding references (about the current length)." /><outline text="For the present meeting, we welcome any general feedback on improving framing, structure, and argument, and, in particular comments on how our contribution may be made most relevant to the water field and the problems it seems to tackle, including what literature may be relevant to relate to." /><outline text="We have written up some (person-) specific queries in red in the endnotes." /><outline text="We look forward to a fruitful discussion." /><outline text="Best wishes, Fenna, Kim and Annelieke&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Tinkering with cleaning practices: Fostering ecologically clean household wastewater&#10;&#10;Kim Verbeke, Annelieke Driessen and Fenna Smits&#10;&#10;Abstract&#10;When people cleaning their homes and themselves in the Netherlands, they use drinking water and discard wastewater." /><outline text="Our concern here is to do with what is difficult or impossible to remove from wastewater, such as chemicals, PFAS, microplastics and pharmaceutical residues, and – once which flows out with the effluent, where it harms organisms that depend on this water." /><outline text="In this article we draw on ten qualitative interviews with people in the Netherlands who, when using and discarding water at home, attempt to care for both hygiene and aesthetics in cleaning practices, while simultaneously caring for the health of ecosystems downstream." /><outline text="Refraining from pinpointing people’s ‘choices’ or ‘behaviour’ as the problem, we explore what facilitates and hinders the achievement of ‘ecologically clean’, where different versions of clean align or clash, and how a sense of responsibility is assigned or handled." /><outline text="In doing so, we develop a more practice-based understanding, firstly, of how ‘ecologically clean’ water is cared for, and secondly, what hinders doing so." /><outline text="In our conclusion we reflect on where the limits are to what households can do, and how household practices in which ‘ecologically clean’ is fostered may best be supported: tinkering with price, availability and materiality (texture/smell) of environmentally friendly products; sharing practical know-how on dosage and use; and challenging of wider social norms and conventions that hinder their improvement may be helpful to encourage and support attempts to better care for water quality in household cleaning practices, whilst also striving for hygienic and aesthetic cleanliness." /><outline text="Introduction &#10;The Netherlands is a country intricately interwoven with water." /><outline text="Located in the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt river delta, there is water in abundance." /><outline text="At the same time, water quality has been a longstanding concern, particularly about the quality of surface waters (rivers, streams, canals, lakes etc.) and the ecosystems that depend on it." /><outline text="The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) has established standards for the chemical and ecological quality of surface waters to be achieved by 2027." /><outline text="The framework is a legal instrument to stimulate protection and improvement of the living environment of aquatic life downstream in all member states." /><outline text="The logic is that by ensuring ‘ecologically clean water’, various forms of human use – such as drinking water extraction and recreation – will also be guaranteed." /><outline text="The directive was established, partly at the insistence of the Dutch government, following fire at the chemical company Sandoz in 1986 that led to the poisoning of aquatic life dependent on Rhine water." /><outline text="However, the Netherlands currently faces a significant challenge in meeting these standards." /><outline text="Within the WFD, wastewater is considered as a significant contributor to the problem that is surface water pollution." /><outline text="For water to be ecologically clean, wastewater must be collected and cleansed before being discharged downstream." /><outline text="But as it is, not all substances can be removed in wastewater treatment facilities." /><outline text="Wastewater that holds harmful substances that cannot be removed, pollutes." /><outline text="Industry and agriculture and horticulture are seen as ‘big polluters’ and thus subject to government regulation and monitoring." /><outline text="Although newspapers often report on the leakage of chemicals and industrial substances from illegal dumping or other scandals, pollutants also regularly enter surface waters through legally permitted discharges from industrial, agricultural, and horticultural activities, such as heavy metals, nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers, and pesticides." /><outline text="On a much smaller scale but in much higher quantity, individual households (users of sewage infrastructure and drinking water) contribute to pollution as well." /><outline text="Households are supplied with water that enters the premises as drinking water and leaves them as wastewater." /><outline text="When people clean their bodies, homes and things (hygienically, aesthetically), they dirty (and sometimes pollute) the water." /><outline text="In other words, in households the practices aimed at accomplishing one version of clean, notably hygienic or aesthetically clean, can come at the expense of another: ecologically clean." /><outline text="The concern with household wastewater is not so much with urine, excrements and toilet paper, as the waste water treatment system was designed to remove just those." /><outline text="Rather, the concern relates to the substances that are discarded along with wastewater: the bleach people use to clean their toilets, the soap they use to wash their dishes, floors and bodies, and so-called ‘micro-pollutants’ – substances that are measured in micro-grams but that can be harmful in small concentrations." /><outline text="These pollutants, including micro and nano plastics, pharmaceuticals, and perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), originate from household applications ranging from cosmetic products and synthetic clothing to pharmaceutical usage and cooking equipment." /><outline text="Such types of contaminants are harder to remove from water in wastewater treatment plants, which means that they flow out with the effluent (or with sewage overflows)." /><outline text="Once this happens, these substances harm organisms that depend on this water, as well as recreational swimmers." /><outline text="Unlike industries and agricultural businesses, households do not require individual permits for discharging their wastewater." /><outline text="Instead, they pay taxes to public institutions responsible for the collection and treatment of domestic wastewater." /><outline text="As taxpayers, users of sewage and wastewater treatment plants are addressed as clients who are to be served indiscriminately." /><outline text="However, referring to them as 'clients' makes it difficult to ask for their cooperation regarding what is discarded with water at home." /><outline text="Policies and campaigns targeting ‘polluting’ households in an effort to reduce their negative impact on water quality address these households in roughly two ways: first, as individual consumers who can make ‘better choices’ for their own health and the environment (e.g. ‘Use as few as possible microplastics (go on a plastic diet)’, and ‘Buy only biodegradable cleaning products’) and second, as individuals who can adopt more ‘water conscious behaviour’ (e.g. flushing only ‘the three P’s – pee, poo and paper – down the loo, or ‘shower less’)." /><outline text="These pollutants, including micro and nano plastics, pharmaceuticals, and perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), originate from various household applications, ranging from cosmetic products and synthetic clothing to pharmaceutical usage and cooking equipment." /><outline text="In this article, we take as our starting point that addressing users of sewage infrastructures for discarded water in terms of individual ‘choice’ and ‘behaviour’ insufficiently aligns with what matters in household households practices – which we take to include showering, bathing children, doing laundry, washing dishes – and thus fails to address some of the challenges of trying to care for water downstream and the organism depended on it, in and through household waste water." /><outline text="We explicitly bracket ideas about what is ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ to do, to instead examine how normativities are at work in situated cleaning practices." /><outline text="Much needed attention and scholarship is directed towards what is ‘bad’ in terms of waste, discards and their toxicity (Balayannis 2019; Liboiron, 2021; Liboiron, Tironi and Calvillo 2018; Nading, 2020; Nixon 2011)." /><outline text="We seek to contribute to this discussion by deliberately taking a different tack, namely to focus specifically on attempts to do ‘good’." /><outline text="Our praxiographic case are household cleaning practices that serve not only ‘hygienic clean’ (it does not cause disease, particularly in humans) and ‘aesthetically clean’ (people deem it pretty and pleasant) (Mol, 2020), but also ‘ecologically clean’ (free of toxins that harms and kills organisms, humans, animals and insects alike)." /><outline text="In what follows, we examine empirical examples of household cleaning practices in which water is used and discarded, and in which care for ‘ecologically clean’ is an ambition." /><outline text="We explore what clean/dirty is in these practices and what other kinds of goods and bads become relevant in them, where different versions of clean align or clash and how they are juggled (traded off, compromised, or mediated), and what is practically needed to collectively care for ecologically clean water in household cleaning." /><outline text="Figure 1." /><outline text="iconographic illustrating how substances from industry and households enter surface water in the Netherlands." /><outline text="Background: Valuing in cleaning practices &#10;Household cleaning practices in which water is used and discarded are diverse and complex." /><outline text="They touch on matters to do with on health, hygiene, and toxicity; the body and the senses; and issues around social norms and expectations." /><outline text="As the goods and bads that matter vary per practice, it is important to pay specific attention to the situated character of cleaning." /><outline text="To do so, we take an approach that Annemarie Mol has termed ‘praxiography’, an approach that is committed to never investigate the object of study in isolation from the practices in which it is enacted (Mol 2002: 33)." /><outline text="The approach avoids centering the human, and instead attends to human as well as non-human actors in webs of sociomaterial relations, thus revealing its roots in Actor Network Theory." /><outline text="Taking this approach does not ‘solve’ the problem of water pollution by households." /><outline text="Instead, it allows us to explore which actors are important, where limits are encountered and how agency is brought about." /><outline text="We set out to think through ‘valuing’ in everyday practices of doing their laundry, cleaning their homes, and washing their bodies." /><outline text="We attend not to values people ‘have’, but instead how they actively do valuing in their everyday lives." /><outline text="In doing so, we take inspiration from studies informed by empirical ethics and material semiotic sensibilities." /><outline text="Firstly, we draw inspiration from a text that has a similar quest, but a case quite distinct from our own - it discusses the case of the ‘good tomato’ and explores how valuing itself is done in practice (Heuts &amp; Mol, 2013)." /><outline text="The result is a list of registers through which tomatoes are made ‘good’, that relate to monetary value (featuring markets, supply and demand, discounts and consumers seeking affordable tomatoes), transportation (featuring concerns with firmness and retaining juiciness); historical time (where tomatoes are placed on a time line that is either continued or deliberately broken with); naturalness (to do with little interference and lack of pesticides); and sensual appeal (including appearance, taste, and touch)." /><outline text="The authors explore how these ‘goods’ and ‘bads’ (are made to) relate – through careful crafting of for instance, by tasting an apple, its monetary value is undone." /><outline text="Here, we build on this work, by including both the doing and undoing of versions of the composite value, clean." /><outline text="But we seek to expand it as well: Here, we are interested in one particular ‘good’, that is, ecologically clean, and how it may be fostered in household cleaning practices that are geared towards serving other types of clean (aesthetically clean, hygienically clean)." /><outline text="We make ourselves analytically sensitive to the interference of one variant of a value in another." /><outline text="In the focus on ‘choice’ and ‘behaviour’, providing and sharing knowledge is foregrounded as a strategy to make change happen." /><outline text="However, as knowledge – or rather ‘knowing’ – is not merely a cognitive endeavour (see Mol, 2021, pp." /><outline text="50–74), we explore how knowledge is done in practice." /><outline text="We take inspiration from the work of empirical ethicist Jeannette Pols’ work on knowledge in everyday practices of patients living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (2012, pp." /><outline text="79–96)." /><outline text="Pols distinguishes three levels of practical knowledge: explicit knowledge (formed from statements of facts about the world), procedural knowledge (based on know-how and skills), and know-now (knowing in a particular situation)." /><outline text="Know-now, Pols asserts, is the activity of interpreting new situations to establish what is the matter here, and what one should do about it – it is particular and practical." /><outline text="It shifts the focus from ‘knowledge’ to ‘knowing’ and what practical arrangements allow for it (see also Gomart &amp; Hennion, 1999)." /><outline text="We take the notion of know-now to highlight the ways in which people at home are responsive and inventive when it comes to cleaning in eco-friendly ways – and to highlight what materialities are relevant to their ability to do just that." /><outline text="Taking these learnings together we ask: What matters to fostering ecological clean in cleaning practices in the home in which water is used and discarded?" /><outline text="Method: Researching the fostering of ecologically clean water at home&#10;Between August and December 2023, Kim (first author) worked as a research intern in the study ‘Clean as a good’, financed by a NWO grant [grant ref] and led by prof." /><outline text="Annemarie Mol." /><outline text="Fenna (second author) supervised Kim’s research, supporting her during data-collection and initial analysis." /><outline text="Annelieke (third author) joined the author team to conduct the analysis and the writing of all drafts." /><outline text="Kim interviewed ten people in the Netherlands about their use of water at home, and her mother (in Belgium)." /><outline text="Interviewees were selected because of their being vocal about ecological worries." /><outline text="All names have been anonymised, except for Kim’s mother, who consented to being named." /><outline text="The interview started with a description of the project, and expression of interest in ‘cleaning practices’ in the widest sense of the word, but always including water, such that it included washing, dishwashing, mopping, showering and toilet use." /><outline text="Kim asked interviewees to show her the products they were using, and surfaces that needed cleaning – (depending on the modality of the interview), and to pretend that she was an ‘alien’ or ‘clown’ who did not know anything about cleaning." /><outline text="She actively acknowledging that this could be somewhat ‘awkward’ but that it would help to bring the practices and their specificities to light." /><outline text="Indeed, Interviewees were often initially reticent to talk about their cleaning practices when they realised the level of detail Kim was seeking." /><outline text="When talking about house cleaning, they frequently emphasised that surely, they ‘do what everybody else does’; when talking about cleaning their bodies the pauses and giggles indicated a degree of intimacy or taboo of the subject." /><outline text="However, the discomfort soon disappeared, and most interviewees were willing to offer detailed accounts of their cleaning practices." /><outline text="Ecological cleanliness proved somewhat elusive in household cleaning practices." /><outline text="(Notably, this is in itself an accomplishment, achieved through the infrastructure designed to take wastewater away)." /><outline text="Consequently, asking interviewees about it, and how it is contributed to or not, required Kim to actively link cleaning practices in which water is used and discarded (aimed at hygiene and aesthetics) to ecological concerns." /><outline text="To do so, she probed and sometimes playfully provoked interviewees with queries about what dirt was here, or how they assessed cleanliness there." /><outline text="Sometimes, interviewees seemed to take this as a critique, and some became moderately irritated." /><outline text="Yet, even these instances, interviewees allowed Kim to probe further, which in all cases led to a joint exploration of these cleaning practices, akin to making our interviewees praxiographers (Heuts &amp; Mol, 2013, p." /><outline text="128; Mol, 2002, pp." /><outline text="26–27)." /><outline text="As a result, interviewees sometimes became reflexively aware of their everyday practices, which meant most came to find the interview helpful for querying their own assumptions, routines and habits, as well as uncovering possible alternatives (see for similar issues with talking about mundane practices Hitchings, 2012)." /><outline text="Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim." /><outline text="A first ordering of the data was undertaken by Kim, after which Annelieke further analysed the material." /><outline text="To guide the analysis, we asked: What enables home and body cleaners to care for ecological clean water?" /><outline text="What are the obstacles and limits?" /><outline text="What does this mean for who/what is assigned responsibility?" /><outline text="Findings: Doing ecologically clean cleaning&#10;The subsequent analysis focuses on what people do when they use water to clean their home and themselves, in a way that seeks to foster ecological cleanliness." /><outline text="We discuss five ways in which these practices are enabled or hindered: 1." /><outline text="Financial cost and time investments; 2." /><outline text="Experiences with effectivity and evaluation; 3." /><outline text="Know-how and know-now; 4." /><outline text="Norms and conventions, and 5." /><outline text="Sensory appreciations." /><outline text="In the conclusion we reflect on potential means of facilitating sustainable water use and discharge, that is, how practices of fostering ecological cleanliness in household cleaning may best be supported and strengthened." /><outline text="Financial cost and time investments &#10;Unsurprisingly, whether ecologically clean is fostered in cleaning practices in the home was firstly influenced by financial cost of biodegradable products." /><outline text="Interviewees told us that products that are good to the environment are often more expensive than their ecologically more harmful counterparts." /><outline text="An always tries to buy organic products, but sometimes she is swayed by the cheaper prices of the non-organic products, or by what is currently on discount in the supermarket." /><outline text="Similarly indicating the importance of the price of a product, Jules used to pay a lot of attention to the sustainability of the washing detergent she uses." /><outline text="But last month, she adds apologetically, she had a ‘dire’ time financially." /><outline text="So, she bought the smaller pack, which is made of plastic, but it is more affordable because it contains less detergent." /><outline text="El, who prefers laundry detergent from Ecover [an eco-friendly brand], switched to the cheapest (ecologically less innocent) laundry detergent after she had a child, which made money tighter, and the product became more expensive due to inflation." /><outline text="Like in the case of valuing tomatoes – people may appreciate particular cleaning products but are not willing or able to pay more for them." /><outline text="It is not that eco-friendly products are necessarily more expensive than other products per se." /><outline text="In the interviews, Germany frequently was deemed to be a country in which sustainability and affordability are enacted together." /><outline text="As one of our interviewees put it: “the idea that sustainability can also be cheap is just more prominent [there than in the Netherlands]”." /><outline text="Some regularly shopped for their favourite brands of eco-friendly cleaning aids, as these were more and significantly more affordable than in the Netherlands." /><outline text="In other words, Germany served as an example of a place where costs do not hinder ecological clean as much as in the Netherlands." /><outline text="Besides price, the use of a non-toxic product also depended on the time and energy it cost to find and use it." /><outline text="Where some were willing to travel to Germany to be able to use eco-friendly products in the Netherlands at a lower cost, An admits to ‘easily deviating’ from her ambition to only buy biodegradable cleaning products." /><outline text="For instance, when she needs a particular cleaning product, and she is not in the place where they sell an organic product, she buys what is in front of her – regardless of its harmful packaging or content." /><outline text="Kim’s mother Mag, who works as a cleaner, tells Kim that one can clean the elements in the oven with garlic and lemons, but that doing so takes more time, which she does not have: “One has a busy life, one goes to work all day… [Using a lemon to clean with] takes more time, Kim." /><outline text="Do you understand?" /><outline text="You must [get] your lemon, you have to rub it into your object, let it soak, rinse and repeat, rinse, repeat." /><outline text="Yes, until it’s clean, right! A lot more time, right?" /><outline text="That’s good for retirees.” Mag laughs, but what she says brings home the importance of ease and convenience, essential to those who live already busy lives." /><outline text="Yet, as ever, the opposite is also true: Mag saw cleaning more often – a bigger time investment – as the way to prevent the need for harsher chemicals, “If you don’t polish something for months, Kim, then [the dirt] sticks, Kimmeken… do you understand?" /><outline text="… You’ll have a hard time getting that off.” But, she explains, if one cleans regularly, and maintains its cleanliness, then no aggressive chemicals are needed." /><outline text="Mag’s relationship between eco-logical cleaning products and time is thus twofold: she is willing to invest time in frequent cleaning to prevent the use of harsh chemicals, but using garlic and lemons rather than chemicals takes too much time, which is why she does not do it." /><outline text="It becomes clear why fostering ecological clean in cleaning practices is not merely about ‘making more conscious choices’: Whether an organic cleaning product is bought or not is related to its financial and temporal implications." /><outline text="However, neither do these determine whether a product is bought and used." /><outline text="Rather, this relates to the cost of other products, what is discounted in the supermarket, its (perceived) quality of a product, the buyer’s financial situation and whether the product is imminently needed." /><outline text="It depends on other things going on in people’s lives that are constantly in flux." /><outline text="As such, the same person may opt for an eco-friendly product in one situation, and for something else in another." /><outline text="Moreover, the practices any product entails need to fit in with other sets of practices that make up (potentially already busy) lives." /><outline text="Experiences with effectivity and evaluation &#10;The repeated use of eco-friendly products, then, depends not only on financial cost and time investment, but also on whether they do what their users expect of or need from them." /><outline text="Previous experiences with the way a product worked play an important role in whether a product is bought again." /><outline text="When the achievement of ecological clean clashed with aesthetic or hygienic cleanliness, this sometimes leads to compromises being made." /><outline text="Whilst Mag prefers organic cleaning products, the type of products she uses (organic or non-organic) depends in part on the dirt in question: “One must always search for ‘with what can I succeed in removing this?’”." /><outline text="The dirtier the object that needs cleaning, the more the use of an ‘aggressive’ product is warranted." /><outline text="Hence, tensions between cleaning the house hygienically and aesthetically, and caring for ecological clean water emerged when products did not accomplish the type of cleanliness expected." /><outline text="Maartje and Vincent, for instance, found that the washnuts they bought for their ‘natural’ qualities, did not remove to the scent of sweat from their clothes: although the clothes came out of the machine smelling clean, the smell of sweat came “right back”, leading them to switch to “the cheapest detergent” of their local supermarket." /><outline text="Describing another clash between hygienic and ecological cleanliness, Sophie said: “Because we have washing machines that use very little water, which is very good [for saving energy], and that can wash at increasingly lower temperatures, which is also very good, you get bacteria formation in your washing machine and then it starts to smell very bad.” Where Maartje and Vincent abandoned the washnuts altogether, Sophie continued washing at low temperatures and interjected the occasional wash at a high temperature to prevent buildup of soap remnants and unpleasant odours in her washing machine." /><outline text="Whether ecological concerns are cared for in these practices, in turn, depends on whether doing so hampers the achievement of aesthetic or hygienic clean." /><outline text="An additional obstacle to the continued use of a water-friendly product came from Tony." /><outline text="This time it did not emerge from a clash between different versions of clean, but instead in problems with assessing cleanliness." /><outline text="Tony used a washing bag marketed with the promise that it retains plastic fibres, preventing them from being washed away with the water." /><outline text="However, knowing the effectiveness of this bag turned out to be problematic." /><outline text="The user instruction on the packaging promised that microplastics would accumulate in the bag with use, but Tony has “never seen anything in there.” Unlike El and Ro, who could sniff their clothes (using their nose to assess its effectivity of the wash nuts), it remained unclear to Tony whether the washing bag ‘worked’ or not." /><outline text="There are limits to assessing effectivity with one’s senses." /><outline text="Although hygienic and aesthetic cleanliness of her clothing were served, Tony could not see whether it served ecological cleanliness too." /><outline text="Consequently, she felt less compelled to put in the extra effort that is separating out clothes that shed microplastics in the washing machine from those that do not." /><outline text="However, Tony did not simply ‘accept’ that she cannot avoid adding microplastics to her wastewater: she now buys fewer synthetic clothes altogether." /><outline text="Hence, whether ecological cleanliness is fostered alongside aesthetic and hygienic cleanliness depends on whether doing so clashes with hygienic and ecological clean." /><outline text="Such clashes may not be come about in a particular practice per se, but rather through their uninterrupted repetition – such as washing on low temperatures – which means that sometimes it makes sense to, at least once every so often, interject a less sustainable practice to be able to sustain the eco-friendlier one." /><outline text="And the assessment of a product’s effectivity, is not always as straightforward, which potentially jeopardises the continued investment of time and labour that the achievement of ecological cleanliness requires." /><outline text="Know-how and know-now&#10;Clearly, knowledge about what is harmful for the environment or not in cleaning practices is significant to whether ecologically clean is fostered or not." /><outline text="How people obtained this knowledge varied." /><outline text="It had frequently been passed on to those we spoke to as part of their upbringing, and some tried to impart it on their own children." /><outline text="Some used a particular product because they were simply ‘used to it’, because they had a sensory association with it (‘it smells familiar’), or because they had been told this was the best product for the job (An’s uses “quite a lot of cleaning vinegar in the bathroom” because her mother had told her that this was “the most efficient and organic way to clean things”)." /><outline text="Anneke teaches her children about the difference between what she feels ‘is’ clean and what ‘just smells clean’: &#10;&#10;“For cleaning [the loo] we only use Ecover’s [toilet cleaner], that you spray into [the toilet] and then clean it with a toilet brush." /><outline text="Our children sometimes complain that it smells a little less fresh." /><outline text="… And when the children think ‘if we did have [one of those cleanings block that hang on the edge]’ or they sometimes mention an aerosol … then I say: guys, that's not clean, that's just a smell." /><outline text="You’re better off cleaning the toilet more often after you’ve used it, so to speak, right?" /><outline text="So that's our conversation here in the house." /><outline text="But that's hard to learn, I think.” &#10;&#10;Once ‘imparted’ this knowledge was not static: for instance, Dora used to like a (non-&#10;organic) toothpaste because it’s what she grew up with and she liked the taste." /><outline text="But then she began to prioritise other qualities in toothpaste, such as whether it was healthy for her gums, and that does not contain microplastics." /><outline text="That she did not like the sour taste did not matter to her – she “soon got over it”." /><outline text="Other ‘informal’ ways of obtaining knowledge about cleaning was obtained from the television: Mag learned about using lemon and garlic to clean with and other ‘tricks’ from a Belgian cleaning programme in her youth." /><outline text="Knowing such tricks helps to clean in an eco-friendly way." /><outline text="But here too, knowledge does not translate directly into application: Mag points out that using lemons to clean with still requires that she thinks of them when she is in the supermarket." /><outline text="To use Pols’ term: Knowing-how is one thing, knowing-now is another." /><outline text="The material effects of a particular product can also make their users abstain from the use that they had learned from their parents, making way for a different way of knowing the product and its effects." /><outline text="Jules uses bleach because it was used in her parental house as she “wouldn't know what else to chuck into a toilet.” When telling Kim about this, she comes to question this practice, calling bleach ‘aggressive stuff’ – and wondering about the ecological effects." /><outline text="Kim asks how she comes to evaluate it as such." /><outline text="Jules responds that if something can change colour because of a product she deems it aggressive, “harsh for the environment’”, because “then it would do the same with coral”." /><outline text="She laughs and adds that this is a very “Caribbean answer to give..." /><outline text="‘Oh no, the fish’.” She and Kim laugh, but Jules continues in all seriousness: &#10;&#10;“Yesterday..." /><outline text="I threw chemical drain opener down the shower drain..." /><outline text="[The] sink was clogged." /><outline text="Water didn't drain." /><outline text="First tried with the plunger, because: better for the environment." /><outline text="Didn't work, so I put a drain opener in..." /><outline text="There was a radish, and it was so beautiful purple at first and then the drain opener was completely gone and everything was unclogged again." /><outline text="But that radish was still there, and it was all white and translucent and half yellow." /><outline text="And then I was really [thinking]..." /><outline text="This water is also going somewhere, and I hope that it won’t encounter too many radishes.’” &#10;&#10;Jules learns about what a cleaning product ‘does’ and whether this is good or bad for the environment by using her own sensory experiences." /><outline text="Reflecting on her unquestioned use of bleach and recalling the way the radish looked after encountering it, makes Jules concerned for where the water goes and what creatures it encounters after she flushes it down the drain." /><outline text="She comes to ‘know’ bleach differently." /><outline text="This opens up the possibility of relating differently to fish through her cleaning practice – namely in a way that cares for the water they depend on for survival and reproduction." /><outline text="Knowledge was also significant to cleaning practices when trying to understand what products contained." /><outline text="Jules cannot assess whether a particular product contains microplastics because she “does not know the words”." /><outline text="Although Anneke took chemistry in school, she struggles to understand the “technical language” on the shampoo bottle that her husband uses for his dandruff problems." /><outline text="She feels that there is ‘quite a lot of junk’ in it, and has tried to find an alternative, but has not yet found one up for the task of fighting dandruff and caring for water simultaneously." /><outline text="Meanwhile, the bottle is there, so the whole family uses it: “It is perhaps also convenient for now." /><outline text="You can't make a fuss about everything." /><outline text="Yeah, so that's a choice." /><outline text="But in the back of my mind, I know that, that, that I actually want to replace it at some point." /><outline text="And again, I have tried it once, but have not yet found the right product.” That Anneke says she has not yet found the right product teaches us about a problem with knowledge: knowing about what is bad, does not necessarily mean knowing what to do instead." /><outline text="The search for another product costs time and energy." /><outline text="Anneke has tried, but not succeeded - yet." /><outline text="So meanwhile, the family continues to use this particular shampoo." /><outline text="Notably, Anneke mentions choice (“so that’s a choice”) to denote the limits of what is feasible for her to do, rather than something that is consciously done." /><outline text="Anneke ’s defence of her family’s practice (“You can’t make a fuss about everything”) can be read as an attempt to deflect a felt sense of responsibility or guilt." /><outline text="Robin also complicates the relationship between knowledge and the (non-)use of particular product." /><outline text="Due to his job at one of the Dutch drinking water providers, Robin is intimately familiar with the processes of collecting, transporting and cleaning wastewater." /><outline text="Yet, he feels that worrying too much about the type and quantity of pollutants, such as microplastics and PFAS, that products may contain, may be more harmful to him than not bothering to investigate the products he uses too closely in the first place: &#10;&#10;“I don't know if there are microplastics in the toothpaste." /><outline text="I am aware of it; I know it exists." /><outline text="But on the other hand, I'm not going to exhaust myself with it, because there’s so much you can worry about." /><outline text="Then you could start thinking: how much PFAS am I ingesting or how clean is the air out here that I walk in every day; that highway that's close by, I don't know what." /><outline text="It's a kind of self-protection: I don't worry about it." /><outline text="I know it exists, but I don't actively work with it, for my own mental health.” &#10;&#10;The emotional labour that fostering ecologically clean water in everyday life points to yet another limit of informing about ecological harm as a strategy to improve care for the environment – there is only so much one can do before becoming exhausted." /><outline text="Our interviews show that knowledge is essential for and in practices in which ecological clean is fostered, not just in the sense of what to do, but also how to do it." /><outline text="People may come by this kind of knowledge in various ways." /><outline text="However, the relation between knowledge and what people do is not at all straightforward: they may do what they are used to, or change their ways, or they can come to reflect on their practices, which may or may not contribute to a (temporary) change in their practices." /><outline text="Moreover, ‘being in the know’ does not translate directly into ‘know-now’." /><outline text="Having said that, when knowledge is sufficiently practical, it may work: e.g., Mag learned about cleaning tricks involving lemons on television, although they too need to be thought of in the moment." /><outline text="What is more, informing consumers about the ingredients so they can make better choices does not align with how cleaners evaluate the products in their cleaning practices (which is frequently related to what it does rather than the active substance at work)." /><outline text="Even those who work in the drinking water sector and are thus well informed about the difficulties of removing certain toxins and substances from water, may ‘block’ off this awareness to not fall into despair." /><outline text="We learn that knowledge of what is ‘bad’ coupled with a sense of helplessness can also lead to excessive worrying and paralysis, and to resignation." /><outline text="These findings point to the limits of the strategy of providing knowledge to effect a change in habits, and the limits of consumer choice to take better care of the environment." /><outline text="Norms and conventions&#10;The conversations Kim had made clear that cleaning is inherently social." /><outline text="Firstly, there is the social norm to clean oneself." /><outline text="Mag put it simply: “Ne mens denkt ‘ik moet gewassen zijn” (“A person thinks ‘I must be washed”) ." /><outline text="Mag does not ponder how this idea is grounded in the history of public health and hygiene, in which sewage and washing of the body came to be not only desirable but expected." /><outline text="Sophie is more aware of the cultured, gendered, and commercialised nature of norms around bodily hygiene; she rages against the vaginal soap marketed at Dutch women in the early 2000s with the underlying message that female genitals needed cleaning with soap: &#10;&#10;“We still have a kind of consumption-like advertising industry about the use of cleaning products." /><outline text="Those horrible feminine hygiene commercials have finally somewhat disappeared, [that] tell you that your vagina stinks and that you should rinse it at least every two days." /><outline text="… When I was younger, that was the case, and everyone was made to feel insecure about that … No! Are you crazy?" /><outline text="Your body can do that all by itself! … It is very nice indeed to have a nice perfume or shampoos, [but] at some point your eyes are opened [to that industry/marketing].” &#10;&#10;Faced with the social expectation of bodily cleanliness, Dora fears that an unkept body could be read as physical proof of her mental health problems, and this very fear contributes to their perpetuation: &#10;&#10;“My relationship with brushing my teeth is sometimes not so straightforward, because sometimes I have depressive episodes." /><outline text="… I know I must do them to take care of myself, but I'm not able to." /><outline text="At the same time, I'm very, very aware of the fact that I haven't been able to take a shower or brush my teeth." /><outline text="So, I also find it very uncomfortable to leave my room because I don't want other people to even notice or think, maybe she has bad breath or she smells because she didn't shower and then it makes it very difficult." /><outline text="And I kind of become paralyzed because sometimes I need to go out to feel better.”&#10;&#10;Social norms thus drive a particular frequency of cleaning and washing practices and contribute to sustaining particular practices but not others." /><outline text="The expectations regarding bodily presentation hamper attempts at doing them less, which would save water and aid water quality." /><outline text="Their interpersonal nature points to a degree of tenacity in the face of attempts to change them." /><outline text="The sociality of cleaning practices furthermore becomes visible in the division of labour between household members when it comes to buying cleaning products and doing the cleaning." /><outline text="Mag, as a professional cleaner, for instance, brings her preferred products to the homes where she does the cleaning." /><outline text="Moreover, when products are already present in the home, different members of the household may use them." /><outline text="The anti-dandruff shampoo of Anneke’s partner was used by her and their children." /><outline text="Jules used her partner’s toothpaste, and the de-scaler that she ‘found’ in her kitchen cabinet without knowing how it got there." /><outline text="Social norms around cleaning and cleanliness can be helpful or hinder the fostering of ecological clean in cleaning practices." /><outline text="Vincent stopped using the washing up bowl that is recommended for saving water because others deemed it ‘vies’ [dirty/yucky], although he was aware that washing with the tub would save water." /><outline text="In this tug of war between virtues (saving water and being clean), water saving lost out." /><outline text="Similarly pointing to a wish to conform to social norms, Jules does not mind skipping a shower when she is on her own, but when she goes out, she makes sure to wash herself beforehand as “a kind of compensation service for other people.” Or when her father, who has nosophobia, was due to visit her, Jules felt compelled to try to make the marble-like kitchen counter shine, something she would otherwise not do." /><outline text="Whilst social norms are tenacious indeed, they are not stable, and notions of ‘what is good’ or what people are subject to change." /><outline text="Illustrating this, Anneke speculates that diminishing the offer of products, and ensuring that what is on offer serves both hygienic as well as ecological clean, that norms around ‘good dishwashing liquid’ will change." /><outline text="Although her idea negates the complex relationships between hygienic clean, aesthetic clean and environmentally clean, it poses an interesting question: if regulation would be focused not only on forbidding harmful substances, but also on endorsing those products that serve a variety of goods, would this be a more cost-efficient way to foster ecological clean water?" /><outline text="Sensory appreciations and pleasures &#10;As many of the examples so far have already illustrated, sensory experiences are key to which and how cleaning products are used, and how often cleaning is done." /><outline text="How something looks, feels and smells (or does not smell), all matter to cleaners." /><outline text="They may be the reason to use something that fosters ecological clean, or indeed, give it up." /><outline text="Maartje uses the lime scale user because she finds the smell pleasant, which – she thinks – is because it is familiar to her." /><outline text="Her partner Vincent comments that it isn’t even nice – pointing out that it is not the smell of the lime scale user per se that makes it pleasant but rather the familiarity of the scent." /><outline text="The couple further uses a soap holder that is screwed into the wall, with a soap block that resembles a lemon, because they found the design ‘charming’ and practical." /><outline text="The soap, an eco-friendly soap with natural dye, replaced the dishwashing liquid they used previously to wash their hands, thus reducing the amount of chemicals washed away with their wastewater." /><outline text="There is also the appreciation of the process of cleaning itself, which again touches on the sensory experience." /><outline text="Sophie appreciated cleaning her boat if it made a visible difference." /><outline text="Jules finds that the ‘pleasure of cleaning’ comes from the feel of a soap on her skin: “The last [face wash] I bought was … like a whipped cream thing...." /><outline text="And I also have a shower gel after now that is one of those tuft-things." /><outline text="That's what makes it like whipped cream – it comes out like a white swirl." /><outline text="I think I just like that (laughs) that I am completely covered in it.” Mag felt better when her hair was not greasy, and using a particular product was her way of caring for her well-being." /><outline text="Sensory experiences may also lead to knowledge about the harmfulness of particular products." /><outline text="Mag reflects that bleach cannot be good for creatures downstream because it affects her lungs when she breathes it in." /><outline text="Chris prefers using dishwashing liquid for his floors, as all-purpose cleaner is ‘more aggressive’ and more suitable for ‘heavy duty’ cleaning." /><outline text="He assesses the level of aggressiveness on his bodily experiences of using the products: when washing the dishes for half an hour his hands feel less irritated than when he uses all-purpose cleaner." /><outline text="These examples drive home that the materiality of a particular product is never merely an additional characteristic, but it can be the main feature that makes them desirable or unattractive." /><outline text="Discussion: Towards a practice-based approach of household wastewater&#10;In this article, we have drawn on interviews with people about their cleaning practices and within them, what hindered and fostered the care for ecologically clean." /><outline text="Our interlocutors told us about how they clean their houses and their bodies, and how they use and discard water in the process." /><outline text="‘Clean’ emerges as a composite value: it is different things when they are alone versus when their father with mysophobia visits; when staying at home versus going out to meet friends; with and without knowing about microplastics." /><outline text="In other words, what clean ‘is’ comes about in sociomaterial practices that comprise a network of heterogeneous actors including humans and non-humans." /><outline text="To guide our analysis, we asked: What matters to fostering ecological clean in cleaning practices in the home in which water is used and discarded?" /><outline text="We elicited five ways in which these practices are enabled or hindered: Financial cost and time investments, Experiences with effectivity and evaluation, Know-how and know-now, Norms and conventions, and Sensory appreciations." /><outline text="Our examples demonstrated that eco-friendly cleaning practices is not at all straightforward." /><outline text="Whether they helped or hindered depended on the specific practices in which they were valued and evaluated." /><outline text="However, we can draw some lessons from them about how to complement framings to do with ‘choice’ and ‘behaviour’ to better address the complexities and potentialities of these efforts, and how they may best be facilitated." /><outline text="Firstly, whilst the emphasis on choice presupposes the only relevant actors in cleaning practices to be rational humans who can and do make decisions, our examples demonstrated that cleaning is distributed across several entities." /><outline text="This does indeed include people: cleaners (those who bought a lemon shaped soap because it looks rustic, or partners who used each other’s shampoo despite disagreeing on the goodness of its contents) or those who commented on cleaning practices (parents who argued with their children who would rather use an aerosol spray than clean frequently, or friends expressing disgust at the use of a washing up tub)." /><outline text="But a whole host of non-human entities come to play a part as well (cleaning products and their specific qualities, well-designed soap holders, lemons and microplastics bags)." /><outline text="To attend to the whole range of relevant actors invites a shift with regard to who is addressed when seeking to foster ecological clean household wastewater." /><outline text="Thirdly, our material shows that an emphasis on choices fails to take into account the practices in which these decisions take shape, that also shape whether and how water is polluted in households - for instance that which happens before and after choosing to buy a product (e.g. remembering to buy an alternative, dosing)." /><outline text="Whether cleaning fosters ecological clean depends not only on the decision for a particular product but also on its use – for instance, whether it removed the dirt in question, whether using it (or not using it) was socially condoned, and whether it could be assessed with eyes and nose." /><outline text="In some instances, reflection on one’s practice could create a concern for their effects on the environment, such witnessing the effect of bleach on a radish." /><outline text="How this translated into cleaning practices remains an empirical question." /><outline text="Thirdly, to speak of choice presupposes a straightforward relationship between knowledge and action: that is, when people know what is ‘good’ then they will do it." /><outline text="Moreover, a framing of choice and behaviour negates that at times there are various ‘goods’ that need attending to, which may clash as well." /><outline text="Whilst having access to the right knowledge plays an important part of in cleaning practices, knowing what is ‘bad’ for water quality did not easily translate into cleaners’ awareness of where and how to make their cleaning practices more eco-friendly." /><outline text="To use Pols’ term, they had know-how but not necessarily know-now." /><outline text="Other practices, and the materialities and norms embedded in them (parents’ cleaning practices, friends’ opinions, or a television show) impacted what they did and could do." /><outline text="Whilst some of our interviewees worried that chemical cleaning products were “synthetic junk” that were “bad for the planet”, their being concerned had limits: the ingredient lists of a particular product were difficult to read and understand, whether an eco-friendly product worked or not proved hard to evaluate, or such a product did not clean as well as its ecologically unfriendly counterpart." /><outline text="In other words, whilst choice implies that there is one right choice, it is not always immediately obvious what this is, and even if it is, product choice is limited by other things and other practices." /><outline text="Although our interviewees were conscious of the need to attune the choices they made in their cleaning practices to the needs of the ecosystems downstream but felt that they were limited in their ability to act on it." /><outline text="In fact, the people we spoke to felt frustrated in their attempts to foster ecological clean, and then finding that they could not due to the sheer cost of eco-friendly products, the contrast with the prices of other products, or their unavailability in the place where they lived, the inefficiency of an eco-friendly product in the face of persistent dirt, and because life events (mental health problems, financial strain, having a child) made it difficult." /><outline text="They ‘defended’ their use of non-ecologically friendly products by saying they ‘also had a life’ (and thus no time to attend to ecological clean), or that their mental health would be affected by worrying too much about these things." /><outline text="Guilt sometimes seemed to be a compensation of falling short one’s own standards." /><outline text="In her study of diabetes care, Annemarie Mol contrasts a ‘logic of choice’ with ‘a logic of care’ (Mol, 2008)." /><outline text="Drawing on an empirical exploration of diabetes care, Mol argues that what makes care good is not offering patients choice per se, but rather the attempts to tinker with knowledge and technologies, to make them fit into messy realities of everyday life with illness." /><outline text="Our findings on care for ecological cleanliness of water suggest that here too the emphasis on offering and encouraging particular choices cannot ensure the achievement of the good that is aspired to." /><outline text="Instead, emphasising choice can be frustrating when messy realities get in the way." /><outline text="When instead cleaning practices that aim for achieving hygienic, aesthetic and ecological clean simultaneously for are taken as a starting point, then tinkering emerges as a way to care for ecologically clean water – which brings with it a focus on materiality, and a sensitivity for particularities and open-endedness." /><outline text="That said, even when sewage users adapt their cleaning practices to better care for the environment and are willing to tinker with and endure the difficulties they encounter along the way, there are limits to what people can do at the household level." /><outline text="This suggests that there is a need to adapt regulations and legal interventions, to subsidise products that achieve the variants of cleanliness simultaneously, and perhaps even to change social conventions and norms about what counts as clean and socially acceptable." /><outline text="Our interviewees dealt with these limits in various ways: by shrugging off the responsibility assigned to individual households, like Robin, who feels that worrying too much would affect his mental health; by compartmentalising, like Mag, who uses eco-friendly products, but uses more chemical products when the dirt in question demands it; or, as Sophie does, by protesting the lack of government action in the face of pressing ecological problems." /><outline text="Conclusion: Tinkering with cleaning practices&#10;Addressing the question of how ecological clean can be fostered in cleaning practices through the lens of material practices, foregrounds that people’s abilities to know and act are contingent on various things and processes (Cohn &amp; Lynch, 2017)." /><outline text="Instead of appealing to better choices or different behaviour, targets for intervention may shift to include not only people but a whole range of entities and other practices." /><outline text="Our analysis allows us to propose some starting points for facilitating a transition to more eco-friendly household cleaning practices." /><outline text="Firstly, rather than emphasising ‘better choices’, tinkering with price and availability of products that are ‘good’ for the environment can help." /><outline text="Carefully attending to the materiality of these products is crucial, as these are not merely ‘add-ons’ for consumers, but often the primary reason for purchasing them or refrain from doing so (a soap that invites you to use it; or a sandy feeling that hinders a pleasant cleaning experience)." /><outline text="Secondly, rather than provide information so that people can make ‘informed choices’, an approach is needed that includes what precedes and follows ‘decisions’." /><outline text="Knowledge can be helpful in changing one’s ways, but it needs to be practice-proximate, and resonates with the way at the household level water is used and discarded, and what is valued in these practices." /><outline text="In other words, it needs to enable ‘know-now’." /><outline text="Thirdly, rather than focusing on behaviour, the task at hand may include challenging wider social norms and conventions that hinder what people do – for instance by subtly and patiently reframing social connotations around bodily odours and perceived uncleanliness (Macphee, 1992)." /><outline text="Taken together, the challenge becomes one of adjusting cleaning products, infrastructure, norms, and conventions in ways that enable better care for the environment that also serves the hygienic and aesthetic cleanliness that is valued in household cleaning practices." /><outline text="References&#10;Abrahamsson, S." /><outline text="(2019)."
